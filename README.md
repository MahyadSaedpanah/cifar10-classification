**CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project**

**Overview**
This project focuses on building and training a deep learning model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The goal is to classify images into one of the 10 categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

**Requirements**
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (for model development and training)
- Torchvision (for dataset loading and pretrained models)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- OS and Datetime (for file handling and logging)

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts. A custom data_loader module is also required to load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
